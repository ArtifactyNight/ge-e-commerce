    title: "The Benefits of Cooking with Cold-Pressed Oils",
    date: "2024-03-15",
    author: "Sarah Johnson",
    content: `Cold-pressed oils have become increasingly popular in modern cooking, and for good reason. These oils, extracted without the use of heat or chemicals, retain more of their natural nutrients and flavors compared to conventionally processed oils.

When oils are cold-pressed, the seeds or fruits are crushed at room temperature, preserving the delicate compounds that can be destroyed by heat. This results in oils that are:

- Higher in antioxidants
- Rich in natural vitamins and minerals
- More flavorful and aromatic
- Free from chemical residues

Popular cold-pressed oils include:
1. Extra virgin olive oil
2. Avocado oil
3. Coconut oil
4. Flaxseed oil

Each of these oils has its unique properties and best uses in cooking. For example, avocado oil's high smoke point makes it perfect for high-heat cooking, while flaxseed oil is best used unheated in dressings and smoothies.`,
